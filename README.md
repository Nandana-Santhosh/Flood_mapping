# Flood Detection with Sentinel-1 Radar Images

## Overview
This project aims to detect flooded areas using Sentinel-1 radar images before and after a flood event. It utilizes the Google Earth Engine platform and Python API for image processing and analysis.

## Features
- Preprocessing of Sentinel-1 radar images
- Filtering and analysis of radar images to identify flooded areas
- Visualization of flood-affected regions on interactive maps
- Implementation of UN-SPIDER recommended flood detection methodologies

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Google Earth Engine Python API
-  Google Colab

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-detection.git


2. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook o Google Colab.

3. Run the provided Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook cells to perform flood detection analysis.

## Data Sources
- Sentinel-1 SAR data from the European Space Agency (ESA)
- Global Surface Water dataset from the Joint Research Centre (JRC)
- Administrative boundaries from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
